# Code Crackers MERN Stack Learning Repository

Welcome to the official **Code Crackers MERN Stack Learning Repository**.  
This repository is designed as a 12-week structured guide to mastering full-stack development with the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** technology stack.

---

## About the Domain: MERN Stack Development

**MERN Stack** is a popular full-stack JavaScript framework used to build modern web applications using:

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL Database
- **Express.js** – Web application framework for Node.js
- **React** – Frontend JavaScript library for building UI
- **Node.js** – Backend JavaScript runtime environment

This stack enables developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, making it efficient and scalable.

Applications built with MERN include:
- Social Networks
- eCommerce Platforms
- Dashboards & Admin Panels
- Real-time Chat Applications
- Portfolio & CMS Systems
